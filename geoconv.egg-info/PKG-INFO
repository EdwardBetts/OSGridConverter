Description: ## OSGridConverter
        
        Libraries to convert between GIS co-ordinate systems, specifically *latitude / longitude* co-ordinates 
        and *easting / northing* co-ordinates based on projection to an ellipsoidal approximation to the geoid.
        In particular, they provide a simpel means to convert between latitude / longitude and UK
        *Ordnance Survey National Grid* co-ordinates of the form **AA 12345 12345**, as found on many maps.
